   _"FunZ—Where Fun Meets Financial Freedom. Your one-stop platform for smart payments, seamless ticketing, and a balanced life."_

5. Unsubscribe Option:

### Technologies Used

- HTML5: Structuring the content of the footer.
- CSS3: Custom styling for responsiveness and branding consistency.
- Font Awesome: For social media icons.
- Google Fonts: Typography using Lexend and Urbanist fonts.
- JavaScript: Placeholder for dynamically displaying user names.

### How to Use:-

   This footer is intended to be integrated into email templates or websites where user communication is important. The `user_name` field can be dynamically populated with the user’s actual name either through backend systems or front-end JavaScript.

### Setup Instructions

- Download the Project: Clone or download the repository files.
- Link CSS and JavaScript: Ensure the styles.css and main.js files are properly linked in your HTML.
- Customize: Update the placeholder text and email addresses with real data as necessary.
- Host Logo: Ensure the FunZ logo (funz_logo.png) is properly hosted or linked in the project.
- Email Integration: This footer can be added to any email campaign template by copying the footer HTML and CSS into your email tool.

### Responsiveness

- The design is fully responsive for various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices, ensuring an optimal experience for users on any platform.
- Uses media queries to adjust layout, font sizes, and spacing based on screen size.

### Customization

- Colors: FunZ's brand colors (primary green, navy blue, and lavender) are used throughout the footer. You can customize these in the :root CSS variables.
- Fonts: The project uses Lexend and Urbanist fonts, which can easily be swapped with your own font preferences.
- Social Icons: Additional social media platforms can be added or removed by adjusting the `<a>` tags and corresponding Font Awesome icons in the social_icons div.

### Future Improvements

- Automate the dynamic name and content population using real-time user data fetched from an API or backend system.
- Add tracking functionality for social media link clicks to analyze user interaction.
